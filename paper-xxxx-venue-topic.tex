        \begin{abstract}
            This is a template for research papers in \LaTeX.
            %
            It is based on the \texttt{elsarticle} class, so if you are submitting to a journal or conference that uses a different class, you will need to modify it accordingly.
            %
            This template include automatic release of the compiled PDF on GitHub Actions.
            %
            It also performs automatic checks on the bibliography.
            %
            With this, I hope to make the life of researchers a bit easier.

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
        %
        This template is structured as follows:
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] \texttt{paper-xxxx-venue-topic.tex} is the main file, where you can write the content of your paper.
            %
            Change the name of this file to match the year (xxxx), venue, and topic of your paper.
            %
            \item[] \texttt{paper-xxxx-venue-topic.sty} is the style file.
            %
            Also change the name of this file to match the year (xxxx), venue, and topic of your paper.
            %
            \item[] \texttt{biblio.bib} is the bibliography file.
            %
            Do not change the name of this file.
            %
            \item[] \texttt{paper-xxxx-venue-topic.pdf} is the compiled PDF.
            %
            You can download it from the Actions tab in your repository.
            %
            \item[] \texttt{figures} is the directory where you can store your figures.
            %
            \item[] \texttt{tables} is the directory where you can store your tables.
            %
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Quirks}\label{sec:quirks}
        %
        There are two main features of this template: automatic release of the compiled PDF on GitHub Actions and automatic checks and fixes on the bibliography.
        %
        \subsection{Automatic Release}\label{subsec:automatic-release}
            %
            The github workflow is defined in the file \texttt{.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-latex.yml}.
            %
            If everything is fine, it generates two compiled files: paper-xxxx-venue-topic.pdf and paper-xxxx-venue-topic-camera-ready.pdf.
            %
            The second file is the same as the first one, but it has been processed by the script \texttt{check\_acknowledgements.rb}.
            %
            This script:
            %
            \begin{itemize}
                %
                \item checks if the string ``\% NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \%'' is present in the acknowledgements section.
                %
                If it is, the script just copies the file to the camera-ready version;
                %
                \item if the file has no acknowledgements section, it prints an error message and stops;
                %
                \item if the file has an acknowledgements section, it prints a warning message and copies the file to the camera-ready version.
                %
                \item if the file has a commented acknowledgements section, it copies the file to the camera-ready version without the comments.
                %
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Automatic Bibliographic Checks and Fixes}\label{subsec:automatic-checks-and-fixes-on-the-bibliography}
            %
            The bibliography is checked before the release of the PDF.
            %
            The checks are performed by the Ruby script \texttt{bibtex\_prettifier.rb}.
            %
            What happens is the following:
            %
            \begin{itemize}
                %
                \item the script checks if there are duplicate keys in the bibliography, and it removes them;
                %
                \item it also checks if a bibtex entry has both \texttt{doi} and \texttt{url} fields, and it removes the \texttt{url} field (this is done because it is redundant and many bibtex styles render two links, which is not good).
                %
            \end{itemize}
